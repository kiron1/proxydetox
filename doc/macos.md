# macOS

The prebuild Proxydetox packages for macOS come with the `proxydetoxctl` utility
shell script for an easier interaction with the launch agent of Proxydetox.

When called without any arguments it will show the status of the Proxydetox
launch agent.

The following sub-commands are supported:

- status
- start
- restart
- stop
- enable
- disable
