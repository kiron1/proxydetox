Proxydetox
==========

A small proxy to relive the pain of some corporate proxies.

Most utilities support the `http_proxy`, `https_proxy` and `no_proxy`
environment variables to handle proxies. On the other side some corporate
networks provide different proxies depending on the destination and for
selecting the correct proxy a [Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file][mdnpac] is
provided. This is inherently incompatible with many tools who only support the
proxy environment variables. Additionally some proxies in coroprate networks
require authentication which can mean that the user name and password is stored
in plain text in environment variables.

This *Proxydetox* software is meant to help in this situation: the Proxydetox
provides a local proxy without authentication. Upon receiving a request
Proxydetox will evaluate the PAC configuration and forward to the correct
parent proxy and also optionally authenticate with them. With Proxydetox it is
enough to set a single proxy running on localhost. This should be compatible
with most tools.

The following authentication methods are supported:

- Basic (use the username and password from `~/.netrc`)
- Negotiate<sup>1</sup>

Installation instructions are provided in the [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) file.

<sup>1)</sup> To enable the negotiate feature, please see the instructions in
[INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).

Alternative solutions
---------------------

- [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org) using the
  [cache_peer](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/cache_peer/) directive and
  translating the given PAC file into Squid ACLs.
- [SpechtLite](https://github.com/zhuhaow/SpechtLite) and translating the PAC
  file into the SpechtLite YAML configuration format.

Components in this repository
-----------------------------

- [duktape-sys](./duktape-sys/) - FFI bindings for Rust of the [duktape](https://duktape.org)
  JavaScript interpreter library written in C.
- [duktape](./duktape/) - Idiomatic Rust wrapper for the `duktape_sys` crate.
  (Just enough which is needed in this product context).
- [paclib](./paclib/) - Functions needed to implement `FindProxyForURL` and wrap it in Rust.
- [paceval](./paceval/) - A utility to evaluate PAC files for a given URL and print the result.
- [proxydetox](./proxydetox/) - The actual Proxydetox software.
